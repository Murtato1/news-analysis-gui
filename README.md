# news-analysis-gui

Creates a GUI that will process news articles scraped in a certain format (The full repo for the scraper is still being worked on), and use GPT-3 to analyze them and extract key insights. The questions that GPT-3 answers can be changed and the .db file can be edited to accomodate for this. 

Made to create .db files that will go into a SQLite database for easy access and file processing.
